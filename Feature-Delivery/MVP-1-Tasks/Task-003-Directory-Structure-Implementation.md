**Task Version:** 1.0  
**Date Created:** 2025-01-19  
**Author:** Citadel AI Infrastructure Team  
**Project:** EPIC-Enterprise-LLM-Server-01  
**MVP Phase:** MVP-1  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours  
**Dependencies:** Task-001-OS-Configuration  
**Assigned To:** System Administrator  
**Status:** NOT-STARTED  

## üìù **TASK OVERVIEW**

### **1.1 Purpose**
Establish the standardized directory layout that supports all operational, development, and maintenance activities, following the aligned framework that maps directly to the documentation hierarchy and provides clear organization for all system components.

### **1.2 Scope**
Create comprehensive directory structure including AI model storage areas, configuration management directories, application source code organization, logging and monitoring data storage, operational scripts and utilities, and integration components with proper access controls and permissions.

### **1.3 Success Criteria**
- Complete directory structure created and properly organized
- AI model storage areas configured with optimized access patterns
- Configuration management directories established with environment-specific settings
- Application source code organized with modular structure
- Logging and monitoring directories configured with proper permissions
- Operational scripts and utilities properly organized and accessible

### **1.4 Dependencies**
- Task-001-OS-Configuration (operating system ready)
- Storage space allocated and accessible
- User permissions and access controls configured
