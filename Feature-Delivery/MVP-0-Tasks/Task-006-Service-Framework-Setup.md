**Task Version:** 1.0  
**Date Created:** 2025-01-19  
**Author:** Citadel AI Infrastructure Team  
**Project:** EPIC-Enterprise-LLM-Server-01  
**MVP Phase:** MVP-0  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours  
**Dependencies:** Task-005  
**Assigned To:** Infrastructure Team  
**Status:** NOT-STARTED  

## üìù **TASK OVERVIEW**

### **1.1 Purpose**
Create the service framework infrastructure including base service templates, vLLM service templates, logging utilities, and metrics collection utilities as specified in the project structure setup guide.

### **1.2 Scope**
- Create base service template with common functionality
- Implement vLLM service template for AI model services
- Set up logging configuration utility
- Create metrics collection utility
- Establish service health checking framework
- Set up service management utilities

### **1.3 Success Criteria**
- Base service template created and functional
- vLLM service template implemented with full functionality
- Logging utility operational with proper configuration
- Metrics collection utility working with Prometheus integration
- Service health checking framework operational
- All service templates can be imported and used

### **1.4 Dependencies**
- Task-005 (Configuration Setup) completed successfully
- Python environment with all required packages

## üîß **TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS**

### **2.1 Implementation Details**
- Create base service template with lifecycle management
- Implement vLLM service template with model loading and inference
- Set up logging utility with configurable log levels
- Create metrics collection utility with Prometheus integration
- Establish service health checking and monitoring
- Set up service management and control utilities

### **2.2 Integration Points**
- Service framework integrates with all AI model services
- Logging utility supports all project components
- Metrics collection integrates with external Prometheus server
- Service templates support systemd integration

### **2.3 Configuration**
- Base service: /opt/citadel/src/citadel_llm/services/base_service.py
- vLLM service: /opt/citadel/src/citadel_llm/services/vllm_service.py
- Logging utility: /opt/citadel/src/citadel_llm/utilities/logging_config.py
- Metrics utility: /opt/citadel/src/citadel_llm/utilities/metrics_collector.py

### **2.4 Basic Security**
- Service templates include proper error handling
- Logging utility supports secure log output
- Metrics collection includes security considerations

## üõ†Ô∏è **IMPLEMENTATION**

### **3.1 Development Approach**
- Follow the service framework setup section from the setup guide
- Create service templates with documented functionality
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Test service template imports and functionality
- Document service template usage and configuration

### **3.2 Testing Requirements**
- Test service template imports and instantiation
- Verify vLLM service template functionality
- Test logging utility configuration and output
- Validate metrics collection and Prometheus integration
- Test service health checking functionality

### **3.3 Documentation**
- Document service template structure and usage
- Create service implementation examples
- Update project documentation with service framework details

## ‚úÖ **VALIDATION & DEPLOYMENT**

### **4.1 Testing**
- Execute service framework validation commands
- Test service template imports and functionality
- Verify vLLM service template with test models
- Validate logging utility configuration and output
- Test metrics collection and external integration

### **4.2 Deployment**
- Service framework ready for AI model service implementation
- All service templates functional and documented
- Logging and metrics utilities operational

### **4.3 Verification**
- All service templates created with correct functionality
- Service imports work correctly
- Logging utility configured and operational
- Metrics collection working with external Prometheus
- Service health checking framework functional

## üîç **QUALITY & COMPLETION**
