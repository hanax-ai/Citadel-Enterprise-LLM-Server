# Task 007: FastAPI API Gateway Setup - MVP-0

**Task Version:** 1.0  
**Date Created:** 2025-01-19  
**Author:** Citadel AI Infrastructure Team  
**Project:** EPIC-Enterprise-LLM-Server-01  
**MVP Phase:** MVP-0  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** 5 hours  
**Dependencies:** Task-006  
**Assigned To:** Infrastructure Team  
**Status:** NOT-STARTED  

## üìù **TASK OVERVIEW**

### **1.1 Purpose**
Implement the FastAPI API Gateway as specified in the project structure setup guide, providing a unified entry point for all AI model services with OpenAI-compatible endpoints and intelligent routing.

### **1.2 Scope**
- Create FastAPI application with OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- Implement intelligent routing to AI model services
- Set up health monitoring for all model services
- Configure CORS middleware and basic rate limiting
- Create API Gateway configuration and management
- Establish service discovery and load balancing

### **1.3 Success Criteria**
- FastAPI API Gateway operational on port 8000
- OpenAI-compatible /v1/chat/completions endpoint functional
- Health monitoring for all model services working
- CORS middleware configured and operational
- Basic rate limiting implemented
- API Gateway configuration properly set up

### **1.4 Dependencies**
- Task-006 (Service Framework Setup) completed successfully
- FastAPI and uvicorn packages installed

## üîß **TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS**

### **2.1 Implementation Details**
- Create FastAPI application with proper structure
- Implement OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint
- Set up health monitoring for model services
- Configure CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
- Implement basic rate limiting (100 requests/minute)
- Create API Gateway configuration management

### **2.2 Integration Points**
- API Gateway integrates with all AI model services
- Health monitoring connects to model service endpoints
- Configuration integrates with external services
- Rate limiting supports operational requirements

### **2.3 Configuration**
- API Gateway: /opt/citadel/src/citadel_llm/api_gateway/main.py
- Configuration: /opt/citadel/config/services/api_gateway.yaml
- Port: 8000
- Model services: ports 11400-11403

### **2.4 Basic Security**
- CORS middleware for secure cross-origin requests
- Basic rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and error handling
- Secure configuration management

## üõ†Ô∏è **IMPLEMENTATION**

### **3.1 Development Approach**
- Follow the FastAPI API Gateway setup section from the setup guide
- Create FastAPI application with documented structure
- Implement OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- Set up health monitoring and service discovery
- Configure middleware and rate limiting
- Test API Gateway functionality

### **3.2 Testing Requirements**
- Test API Gateway startup and configuration
- Verify OpenAI-compatible endpoint functionality
- Test health monitoring for model services
- Validate CORS middleware configuration
- Test rate limiting functionality
- Verify error handling and logging

### **3.3 Documentation**
- Document API Gateway structure and endpoints
- Create API usage examples and documentation
- Update project documentation with API Gateway details

## ‚úÖ **VALIDATION & DEPLOYMENT**

### **4.1 Testing**
- Execute API Gateway validation commands
- Test FastAPI application startup and configuration
- Verify OpenAI-compatible endpoint with test requests
- Test health monitoring and service discovery
- Validate CORS and rate limiting functionality

### **4.2 Deployment**
- API Gateway ready for production deployment
- All endpoints functional and documented
- Configuration management operational

### **4.3 Verification**
- API Gateway starts successfully on port 8000
- OpenAI-compatible endpoints respond correctly
- Health monitoring reports service status
- CORS middleware handles cross-origin requests
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

## üîç **QUALITY & COMPLETION**
