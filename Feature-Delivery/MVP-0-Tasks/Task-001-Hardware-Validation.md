**Assigned To:** Infrastructure Team  
**Status:** NOT-STARTED  

## üìù **TASK OVERVIEW**

### **1.1 Purpose**
Validate that the target server (hx-llm-server-01) meets all hardware requirements specified in the project structure setup guide and actual server configuration document.

### **1.2 Scope**
- Verify CPU specifications (AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7965WX)
- Validate memory capacity (256GB DDR5 ECC)
- Confirm storage configuration (NVMe and archive storage)
- Check GPU specifications (Dual NVIDIA RTX 5060 Ti)
- Verify network configuration and connectivity

### **1.3 Success Criteria**
- All hardware components match documented specifications
- Storage devices are properly mounted and accessible
- GPU drivers are installed and functional
- Network connectivity to external services is established
- Hardware validation script passes all checks

### **1.4 Dependencies**
- Server access and administrative privileges
- Network connectivity to external services

## üîß **TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS**

### **2.1 Implementation Details**
- Execute hardware validation commands as specified in setup guide
- Verify CPU architecture and specifications
- Check memory capacity and type
- Validate storage mount points and capacity
- Test GPU availability and driver functionality
- Confirm network IP and hostname configuration

### **2.2 Integration Points**
- Hardware validation integrates with system setup procedures
- Results feed into subsequent configuration tasks
- Validation script output used for documentation

### **2.3 Configuration**
- No specific configuration required for validation
- Use standard system commands for hardware detection
- Follow validation script format from setup guide

### **2.4 Basic Security**
- Ensure validation commands are run with appropriate permissions
- Document any security-related hardware findings

## üõ†Ô∏è **IMPLEMENTATION**

### **3.1 Development Approach**
- Follow the hardware validation section from the setup guide
- Execute validation commands in sequence
- Document any discrepancies or issues found
- Create validation report for project documentation

### **3.2 Testing Requirements**
- Run all hardware validation commands
- Verify expected outputs match documented specifications
- Test GPU functionality with nvidia-smi
- Validate storage mount points and permissions

### **3.3 Documentation**
- Create hardware validation report
- Document any hardware issues or discrepancies
- Update project documentation with validation results

## ‚úÖ **VALIDATION & DEPLOYMENT**

### **4.1 Testing**
- Execute hardware validation script from setup guide
- Verify all hardware components are detected correctly
- Test GPU functionality and driver compatibility
- Validate storage access and permissions

### **4.2 Deployment**
- Hardware validation is a prerequisite for all other tasks
- Results determine if server meets project requirements
- Any hardware issues must be resolved before proceeding

### **4.3 Verification**
- All validation commands return expected results
- Hardware specifications match documented requirements
- No critical hardware issues identified

## üîç **QUALITY & COMPLETION**

### **5.1 Quality Standards**
- All hardware components must be validated
