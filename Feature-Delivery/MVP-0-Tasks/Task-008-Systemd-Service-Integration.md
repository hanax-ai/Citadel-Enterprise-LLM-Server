**Author:** Citadel AI Infrastructure Team  
**Project:** EPIC-Enterprise-LLM-Server-01  
**MVP Phase:** MVP-0  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours  
**Dependencies:** Task-007  
**Assigned To:** Infrastructure Team  
**Status:** NOT-STARTED  

## üìù **TASK OVERVIEW**

### **1.1 Purpose**
Implement systemd service integration for all Citadel services as specified in the project structure setup guide, providing proper lifecycle management, resource control, and operational procedures.

### **1.2 Scope**
- Create systemd service templates for all AI model services
- Implement API Gateway systemd service
- Set up service management scripts and utilities
- Configure service dependencies and startup ordering
- Establish service monitoring and health checking
- Create service logging and journald integration

### **1.3 Success Criteria**
- All systemd service files created and functional
- Service management scripts operational
- Service dependencies and startup ordering configured
- Service monitoring and health checking working
- Service logging integrated with journald
- All services can be managed via systemd

### **1.4 Dependencies**
- Task-007 (FastAPI API Gateway Setup) completed successfully
- Administrative access for systemd configuration

## üîß **TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS**

### **2.1 Implementation Details**
- Create systemd service files for all AI model services
- Implement API Gateway systemd service
- Set up service management scripts (citadel-systemd)
- Configure service dependencies and startup ordering
- Establish service monitoring and health checking
- Create service logging and journald integration

### **2.2 Integration Points**
- Systemd services integrate with all project components
- Service management scripts support operational procedures
- Service monitoring integrates with health checking
- Logging integrates with journald and external monitoring

### **2.3 Configuration**
- Service files: /opt/citadel/config/systemd/
- Management script: /opt/citadel/bin/citadel-systemd
- Service user: citadel
- Service group: citadel
- Model services: ports 11400-11403
- API Gateway: port 8000

### **2.4 Basic Security**
- Service security settings (NoNewPrivileges, PrivateTmp)
- Resource limits and memory controls
- Secure file permissions and access controls
- Service isolation and protection

## üõ†Ô∏è **IMPLEMENTATION**

### **3.1 Development Approach**
- Follow the systemd service integration section from the setup guide
- Create systemd service files with documented configuration
- Implement service management scripts and utilities
- Configure service dependencies and startup ordering
- Test service installation and management
- Document service configuration and usage

### **3.2 Testing Requirements**
- Test systemd service file installation
- Verify service startup and shutdown procedures
- Test service dependencies and startup ordering
- Validate service monitoring and health checking
- Test service logging and journald integration

### **3.3 Documentation**
- Document systemd service configuration and usage
- Create service management procedures
- Update project documentation with systemd details

## ‚úÖ **VALIDATION & DEPLOYMENT**

### **4.1 Testing**
- Execute systemd service validation commands
- Test service installation and management
- Verify service startup and shutdown procedures
- Test service dependencies and startup ordering
- Validate service monitoring and health checking

### **4.2 Deployment**
- Systemd services ready for production deployment
- Service management scripts operational
- All services can be managed via systemd

### **4.3 Verification**
- All systemd service files installed correctly
- Services start and stop properly
- Service dependencies work correctly
- Service monitoring and health checking functional
- Service logging integrated with journald

## üîç **QUALITY & COMPLETION**
