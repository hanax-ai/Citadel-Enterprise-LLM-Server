# Task 004: Project Directory Structure Setup - MVP-0

**Task Version:** 1.0  
**Date Created:** 2025-01-19  
**Author:** Citadel AI Infrastructure Team  
**Project:** EPIC-Enterprise-LLM-Server-01  
**MVP Phase:** MVP-0  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours  
**Dependencies:** Task-003  
**Assigned To:** Infrastructure Team  
**Status:** NOT-STARTED  

## üìù **TASK OVERVIEW**

### **1.1 Purpose**
Create the complete project directory structure as specified in the project structure setup guide, including all necessary directories for source code, configuration, logs, models, and operational scripts.

### **1.2 Scope**
- Create base project directory structure at /opt/citadel
- Set up source code directories for all project components
- Create configuration directories with proper organization
- Establish model storage directories on NVMe and archive storage
- Set up logging and operational directories
- Configure proper permissions and ownership

### **1.3 Success Criteria**
- Complete directory structure created as specified in setup guide
- All directories have correct ownership (citadel:citadel)
- Proper permissions set for security and functionality
- Model storage directories accessible on both NVMe and archive storage
- Directory structure supports all MVP phases

### **1.4 Dependencies**
- Task-003 (Python Environment Setup) completed successfully
- Storage devices mounted and accessible

## üîß **TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS**

### **2.1 Implementation Details**
- Create base project directory at /opt/citadel
- Set up source code structure for citadel_llm package
- Create configuration directories for global, services, features, environments
- Establish model storage on /mnt/nvme0n1/models
- Set up log storage on /mnt/sda/logs/llm
- Create operational script directories

### **2.2 Integration Points**
- Directory structure supports all project components
- Model storage integrates with vLLM services
- Log storage supports monitoring and debugging
- Configuration structure supports multi-environment deployment

### **2.3 Configuration**
- Base directory: /opt/citadel
- Source code: /opt/citadel/src/citadel_llm
- Configuration: /opt/citadel/config
- Models: /mnt/nvme0n1/models
- Logs: /mnt/sda/logs/llm
- Scripts: /opt/citadel/bin

### **2.4 Basic Security**
- Proper file permissions (755 for directories, 700 for secrets)
- Secure secrets directory configuration
- Appropriate ownership for all directories

## üõ†Ô∏è **IMPLEMENTATION**

### **3.1 Development Approach**
- Follow the directory structure section from the setup guide
- Create directories in the specified hierarchy
- Set ownership and permissions as documented
- Verify each directory creation step
- Document any deviations from expected structure

### **3.2 Testing Requirements**
- Verify all directories created with correct paths
- Test directory permissions and ownership
- Validate model storage accessibility
- Confirm log directory structure

### **3.3 Documentation**
- Document directory structure creation process
- Record any structural changes or additions
- Update project documentation with directory details

## ‚úÖ **VALIDATION & DEPLOYMENT**

### **4.1 Testing**
- Verify all directories exist with correct paths
- Test directory permissions and ownership
- Validate storage mount points and accessibility
- Confirm directory structure matches setup guide

### **4.2 Deployment**
- Directory structure ready for service implementation
- All components have appropriate storage locations
- Configuration structure supports deployment

### **4.3 Verification**
- All directories created with correct permissions
- Storage directories accessible and writable
- Directory structure supports project requirements
- No missing or incorrectly configured directories

## üîç **QUALITY & COMPLETION**

### **5.1 Quality Standards**
- All directories must be created with correct paths
- Permissions must be set appropriately for security
- Ownership must be configured correctly
- Directory structure must match documented specifications
