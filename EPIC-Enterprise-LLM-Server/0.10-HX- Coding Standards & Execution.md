## 1. 🎯 **INTRODUCTION AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT**

This document outlines the mandatory coding standards, execution protocols, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) methodologies for the HXP-Enterprise LLM Server project. These standards are designed to ensure complete alignment with the project's architecture, modular library, and high-level tasks while maintaining strong OOP principles for scalability, maintainability, and operational excellence.

### **1.1. Core Objectives:**
- **Architecture Alignment:** Ensure all code directly maps to architectural components and specifications.
- **Modular Integration:** Promote the use of reusable components from the modular library.
- **Performance Excellence:** Meet or exceed performance targets for latency, throughput, and resource utilization.
- **Operational Readiness:** Implement comprehensive monitoring, testing, and deployment standards.
- **Quality Assurance:** Maintain high code quality through automated testing, code reviews, and static analysis.

### **1.2. Project Context:**
- **Primary Purpose:** HXP-Enterprise LLM Server hosting 4 AI models with advanced monitoring and API capabilities.
- **Server Location:** 192.168.10.29 (hx-llm-server-01)
- **Technical Stack:** Python 3.12.3, vLLM, FastAPI, Prometheus, Grafana, Docker
- **Performance Requirements:** Model-specific latency and throughput targets.

## 2. 🏗️ **FOUNDATIONAL OOP AND SOLID PRINCIPLES**

### **2.1. Mandatory OOP Principles:**
- **Encapsulation:** Object state must be protected with private/protected access modifiers. Functionality is exposed through public methods.
- **Abstraction:** Classes must expose only essential information, hiding complex implementation details through abstract classes and interfaces.
- **Inheritance:** Use inheritance strictly for "is-a" relationships. **Prefer composition over inheritance** for "has-a" relationships.
- **Polymorphism:** Design objects to exhibit behavior based on their specific type at runtime, leveraging method overriding and interfaces.

### **2.2. Strict SOLID Principles Compliance:**
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class and module must have one, and only one, reason to change.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities must be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering program correctness.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Clients must not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules must not depend on low-level modules; both must depend on abstractions.

## 3. 📝 **GENERAL CODING STANDARDS AND PRACTICES**

### **3.1. Naming Conventions:**
- **Standard:** Adhere to Python's PEP 8 naming conventions (`snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes).
- **Clarity:** Use clear, descriptive, and unambiguous names. Avoid generic names and excessive abbreviations.
- **Constants:** Use `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES` for constants.

### **3.2. Code Readability and Formatting:**
- **Standard:** Follow Black code formatter with an 88-character line limit.
- **Automation:** Use Black and isort for automated formatting and import sorting.
- **Comments:** Use comments to explain *why* code does something, not *what* it does. Strive for self-documenting code.

### **3.3. Modularity and Cohesion:**
- **Rule:** Break down large problems into small, highly cohesive units (classes, methods).
- **Guideline:** Methods should perform one specific task. Classes should have a single, well-defined responsibility (SRP).

### **3.4. Low Coupling:**
- **Rule:** Minimize dependencies between distinct components.
- **Guideline:** Avoid "God objects." Pass necessary dependencies as parameters or inject them.

### **3.5. Error Handling and Exception Management:**
- **Rule:** Implement robust and predictable error handling with custom exception classes.
- **Guideline:** Use specific exceptions instead of generic ones. Handle exceptions at the appropriate layer and log critical errors.

### **3.6. Code Quality and Standards:**
- **Rule:** All new features and bug fixes must follow established coding standards and best practices.
- **Guideline:** Use automated code formatting (Black), linting (flake8), and type checking (mypy) for code quality.

### **3.7. Version Control (Git):**
- **Rule:** Adhere to GitHub Flow branching strategy.
- **Guideline:** Commit small, atomic changes frequently with clear, descriptive commit messages.

### **3.8. Code Reviews:**
- **Rule:** All code changes must undergo a mandatory peer code review before merging.
- **Guideline:** Provide constructive and actionable feedback, focusing on adherence to standards and design quality.

### **3.9. Design Patterns:**
- **Guideline:** Leverage established OOP design patterns (e.g., Factory, Strategy, Observer) to solve recurring design problems.

### **3.10. Refactoring:**
- **Rule:** Continuously refactor code to improve its internal structure and readability without changing its external behavior.

### **3.11. Documentation:**
- **Rule:** Public APIs must be clearly documented with their purpose, parameters, return values, and exceptions.
- **Docstring Format:** Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions and classes.

## 4. 📦 **SERVICE IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS**

### **4.1. AI Model Service Implementation:**
- **Rule:** Implement all AI model services using vLLM inference engine with Hugging Face models.
- **Guideline:** Follow the defined service structure for AI model services, infrastructure services, and integration services.
- **Example:**
  ```python
  from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams
  from transformers import AutoTokenizer
  
  class MixtralService:
      def __init__(self, model_name: str = "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1"):
          self.llm = LLM(model=model_name)
          self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
      
      async def generate_response(self, prompt: str) -> str:
          sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.7, max_tokens=512)
          outputs = self.llm.generate([prompt], sampling_params)
          return outputs[0].outputs[0].text
  ```

### **4.2. Configuration Management:**
- **Rule:** Use service-specific configuration schemas with Pydantic validation.
- **Guideline:** Validate all configurations against the defined schemas on startup.
- **Example:**
  ```python
  from pydantic import BaseModel
  
  class MixtralServiceConfig(BaseModel):
      port: int = 11400
      memory_limit_gb: int = 90
      cpu_cores: int = 8
      model_name: str = "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1"
      max_tokens: int = 512
      temperature: float = 0.7
  ```

### **4.3. Service Health and Monitoring:**
- **Rule:** Implement comprehensive health checks and monitoring for all services.
- **Guideline:** Use standardized health check patterns and Prometheus metrics.
- **Example:**
  ```python
  from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge
  
  class ServiceHealth:
      def __init__(self):
          self.request_counter = Counter('requests_total', 'Total requests')
          self.response_time = Histogram('response_time_seconds', 'Response time')
          self.active_connections = Gauge('active_connections', 'Active connections')
      
      async def health_check(self) -> dict:
          return {
              "status": "healthy",
              "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
              "version": "1.0.0"
          }
  ```

### **4.4. Error Handling and Logging:**
- **Rule:** Implement comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions and structured logging.
- **Guideline:** Use specific exception types and log critical errors with context.
- **Example:**
  ```python
  import logging
  from typing import Optional
  
  class ModelInferenceError(Exception):
      """Raised when model inference fails"""
      pass
  
  class ResourceAllocationError(Exception):
      """Raised when resource allocation fails"""
      pass
  
  class AIModelService:
      def __init__(self):
          self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
      
      async def generate_response(self, prompt: str) -> Optional[str]:
          try:
              # Model inference logic
              return response
          except Exception as e:
              self.logger.error(f"Model inference failed: {e}", exc_info=True)
              raise ModelInferenceError(f"Inference failed: {e}")
  ```
